The Checkly CLI, SDK and Constructs in this repo together form the basic building blocks of the Checkly Monitoring-as-Code 
(MaC) workflow.

This goal of this repo and the larger MaC project is to deliver a Javascript/Typescript-native workflow for creating,
debugging, deploying and life cycling synthetic monitors (checks) at scale, from your code base.

# Getting Started

First, install the CLI.  

```bash
npm i --save-dev @checkly/cli 
```

To use TypeScript, also install `ts-node` and `typescript`:

```bash
npm i --save-dev ts-node typescript
```

Create a `checkly.config.js` (or `checkly.config.ts`) at the root of your project.

```js
const config = {
  projectName: 'My First Checkly Project',
  logicalId: 'checkly-project-1',
  checks: {
    activated: true,
    muted: false,
    runtimeId: '2022.10',
    frequency: 5,
    locations: ['us-east-1', 'eu-west-1'],
  }
}

module.exports = config;
```

Use the CLI to authenticate and pick a Checkly account. Make sure you have [signed up for a free account on checklyhq.com](https://www.checklyhq.com/).

```bash
npx checkly login
```

Now, let's create your first synthetic monitoring check, starting with a `@playwright/test` based Browser check. Create a file named `__checks__/home.spec.js`.

```js
const { expect, test } = require('@playwright/test')

test('Playwright home page', async ({ page }) => {
  const response = await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/')
  expect(response.status()).toBeLessThan(400)
  expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Playwright/)
  await page.screenshot({ path: 'homepage.jpg' })
})
```

Now run `npx checkly test` to do a dry run against the global Checkly infrastructure so we validate we didn't make any mistakes. 
This should print the message:

```
 PASS  - home.spec.js

Checks:    1 passed,  1 total
â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ
```

After you have validated the check does the right thing and has no bugs, deploy the check to your account:

```bash
npx checkly deploy
```

Et voilÃ , you have just created a synthetic monitoring check based on Playwright from your code base! Open up [your Checkly dashboard](https://app.checklyhq.com) and you should see a your Check, ready to start monitoring
around the clock.

# Project structure

The getting started example above uses a set of defaults and conventions to get you going quickly. In more complex cases
you will want more control. The recommended way to tackle this is using a mix of **global** and **local** 
configuration.

## Global configuration

Create a `checkly.config.js` (or `checkly.config.ts`) at the root of your project.

```js
// @ts-check

/** @type {import('@checkly/cli').ProjectConfig} */
const config = {
  projectName: 'Website Monitoring',
  logicalId: 'website-monitoring-1',
  repoUrl: 'https://github.com/acme/website',
  checks: {
    activated: true,
    muted: false,
    runtimeId: '2022.10',
    frequency: 5,
    locations: ['us-east-1', 'eu-west-1'],
    tags: ['website', 'api'],
    alertChannels: [],
    checkMatch: '**/*.check.js',
    browserChecks: {
      frequency: 10,
      checkMatch: '**/*.spec.js',
    }
  },
  cli: {
    verbose: false,
    runLocation: 'eu-west-1',
  }
}

module.exports = config;
```

- `checkMatch`: By default, Checkly looks for files matching `.*check\.(js|ts)`.

## Local configuration

You can override any of the settings in the `checks` global configuration section at the individual check level.

```js
// __check__/api.check.js
const { ApiCheck } = require('@checkly/cli/constructs')

const api = new ApiCheck('hello-api', {
  name: 'Hello API',
  locations: ['ap-south-1'], // overrides the locations property
  frequency: 30, // overrides the frequency property
  request: {
    method: 'GET',
    url: 'https://api.checklyhq.com/public-stats',
    assertions: [{ source: 'STATUS_CODE', comparison: 'EQUALS', target: '200' }]
  }
})
```

# CLI

Dry run all checks in your repo:

```bash
npx checkly test
```

Dry run checks that have `product` and `api` in the file name

```bash
npx checkly test product api
```

Dry run checks while passing a specific URL and a password. These variables are available on `process.env`

```bash
npx checkly test --env "ENVIRONMENT_URL=https://preview.acme.com" --env PASSWORD=doremiabc123
```

Dry run all checks against a specific location:

```bash
npx checkly test --location eu-west-1
```

Deploy all resources to your Checkly account

```bash
npx checkly deploy
```

## Reference

### `npx checkly test`

Executes all the checks in the scope of your project on the Checkly cloud infrastructure. You can specify files to run by
appending a pattern, e.g. `npx checkly test home.spec.js api`. 

This very powerful when combined with passing environment variables using one of the flags `--env` or `--env-file` as you 
can target staging, test and preview environment with specific URLs, credentials and other common variables that differ 
between environments.

- `--location <location>` or `-l`: Run checks against a specified location, e.g. `eu-west-1`. Defaults to `us-east-1`.
- `--grep <pattern>` or `-g`: Only run checks where the check name matches a regular expression.
- `--env <key=value>` or `-e`: Pass environment variables to the check execution runtime. Variables passed here overwrite
any existing variables stored in your Checkly account.
- `--env-file`: You can read variables from a `.env` file by passing the file path e.g. `--env-file="./.env"`

### `npx checkly deploy`

Deploys all your checks and associated resources like alert channels to your Checkly account.

- `--force` or `-f`: Skips the confirmation dialog when deploying. Handy in CI environments.

# Authentication

There are different ways to authenticate when using the CLI depending on the environment where you are running the CLI from.

## Interactive

When **running the CLI interactively** from your dev environment, just use the built-in `login` command. If you have multiple
Checkly accounts, it will prompt which account you want to target

```bash
npx checkly login
```

Once authenticated, you can switch between accounts using

```bash
npx checkly switch
```

or quickly find out which account you are currently targeting with

```bash
npx checkly whoami
```

## From CI

When **running the CLI from your CI pipeline** you will need to export two variables in the shell:
- `CHECKLY_API_KEY`
- `CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID`

Go to your Settings page in Checkly and grab a fresh API key from [the API keys tab](https://app.checklyhq.com/settings/user/api-keys) and your
Account ID from the [Account settings tab](https://app.checklyhq.com/settings/account/general).


# Creating Checks, Alert Channels and other resources

Every resource you create using the Checkly CLI is represented by a "construct": it's a class you import from `@checkly/cli/constructs`.
A construct is the "as-code" representation of the eventual resource created / deleted / updated on the Checkly cloud once
you run `npx checkly deploy`.

Remember the following rules when creating and updating constructs:

1. Every construct needs to have a `logicalId`. This is the first argument when instantiating a class, i.e. 
```js 
const check  = new ApiCheck('my-logical-id', { name: 'My API check' })
```
2. Every `logicalId` needs to be unique within the scope of a `Project`. A Project also has a `logicalId`. 
3. A `logicalId` can be any string up to 255 characters in length.
4. There is no hard limit on the amount of `Project`'s you can have in your Checkly account.

Behind the scenes, we use the `logicalId` to create a graph of your resources so we now what to persist, update and remove 
from our database. Changing the `logicalId` on an existing resource in your code base will tell the Checkly backend that 
a resource was removed and a new resource was created.

So, I guess you know now that logical IDs are important!

- assertions

```
â”œâ”€â”€ __checks__
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ api.check.js
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ setup.js
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ teardown.js
```

```js
const { ApiCheck } = require('@checkly/cli/constructs')
const path = require('path')
const { readFileSync } = require('fs')


new ApiCheck('hello-api-1', {
  name: 'Hello API',
  localSetupScript: readFileSync(path.join(__dirname, 'setup.js'), 'utf-8'),
  localTearDownScript: readFileSync(path.join(__dirname, 'teardown.js'), 'utf-8'),
  request: {
    method: 'GET',
    url: 'https:///api.acme.com/v1/hello',
    skipSsl: false,
    followRedirects: true,
    assertions: [
      { source: 'STATUS_CODE', regex: '', property: '', comparison: 'EQUALS', target: '200' },
      { source: 'JSON_BODY', regex: '', property: '$.name', comparison: 'NOT_EMPTY', target: '' }
    ]
  }
})
```

### Browser Checks

Browser checks are based on [`@playwright/test`](https://playwright.dev/). You can just write `.spec.js|ts` files with test cases
and the Checkly CLI will pick them up and apply some default settings like a name, run locations and run frequency to turn 
them into synthetic monitoring checks.

However, you can override these global settings and configure individual Browser checks just like all other built-in check
types. The most important thing to is set the `code.entrypoint` property and point it to your Playwright `.spec.js|ts` file.

```js
const { BrowserCheck } = require('@checkly/cli/constructs')

new BrowserCheck('browser-check-1', {
  name: 'Browser check #1',
  frequency: 10, // minutes
  regions: ['us-east-1', 'eu-west-1'],
  code: {
    entrypoint: './home.spec.js'
  }
})
```
