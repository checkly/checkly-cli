The Checkly CLI, SDK and Constructs in this repo together form the basic building blocks of the Checkly Monitoring-as-Code 
(MaC) workflow.

This goal of this repo and the larger MaC project is to deliver a Javascript/Typescript-native workflow for creating,
debugging, deploying and life cycling synthetic monitors (checks) at scale, from your code base.
