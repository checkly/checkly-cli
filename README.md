The Checkly CLI, SDK and Constructs in this repo together form the basic building blocks of the Checkly Monitoring-as-Code 
(MaC) workflow.

This goal of this repo and the larger MaC project is to deliver a Javascript/Typescript-native workflow for creating,
debugging, deploying and life cycling synthetic monitors (checks) at scale, from your code base.

# Getting Started

First, install the CLI.  

```bash
npm i --save-dev @checkly/cli 
```

Create a `checkly.config.js` (or `checkly.config.ts`) at the root of your project.

```js
const config = {
  projectName: 'My First Checkly Project',
  logicalId: 'checkly-project-1',
  checks: {
    activated: true,
    muted: false,
    runtimeId: '2022.10',
    frequency: 5,
    locations: ['us-east-1', 'eu-west-1'],
  }
}

module.exports = config;
```

Use the CLI to authenticate and pick a Checkly account. Make sure you have [signed up for a free account on checklyhq.com](https://www.checklyhq.com/).

```bash
checkly login
```

Now, let's create your first synthetic monitoring check, starting with a `@playwright/test` based Browser check. Create a file named `__checks__/home.spec.js`.

```js
const { expect, test } = require('@playwright/test')

test('Playwright home page', async ({ page }) => {
  const response = await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/')
  expect(response.status()).toBeLessThan(400)
  expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Playwright/)
  await page.screenshot({ path: 'homepage.jpg' })
})
```

Now run `npx checkly test` to do a dry run against the global Checkly infrastructure so we validate we didn't make any mistakes. 
This should print the message:

```
 PASS  - home.spec.js

Checks:    1 passed,  1 total
â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ
```

After you have validated the check does the right thing and has no bugs, deploy the check to your account:

```bash
npx checkly deploy
```

Et voilÃ , you have just created a synthetic monitoring check based on Playwright from your code base! Open up [your Checkly dashboard](https://app.checklyhq.com) and you should see a your Check, ready to start monitoring
around the clock.

# Project structure

The getting started example above uses a set of defaults and conventions to get you going quickly. In more complex cases
you will want more control. The recommended way to tackle this is using a mix of **global** and **local** 
configuration.

## Global configuration

Create a `checkly.config.js` (or `checkly.config.ts`) at the root of your project.

```js
// @ts-check

/** @type {import('@checkly/cli').ProjectConfig} */
const config = {
  projectName: 'Website Monitoring',
  logicalId: 'website-monitoring-1',
  repoUrl: 'https://github.com/acme/website',
  checks: {
    activated: true,
    muted: false,
    runtimeId: '2022.10',
    frequency: 5,
    locations: ['us-east-1', 'eu-west-1'],
    tags: ['website', 'api'],
    alertChannels: [],
    checkMatch: '**/*.check.js',
    browserChecks: {
      frequency: 10,
      checkMatch: '**/*.spec.js',
    }
  },
  cli: {
    verbose: false,
    runLocation: 'eu-west-1',
  }
}

module.exports = config;
```

- `checkMatch`: By default, Checkly looks for files matching `.*check\.(js|ts)`.

## Local configuration

You can override any of the settings in the `checks` global configuration section at the individual check level.

```js
// __check__/api.check.js

const api = new ApiCheck('hello-api', {
  name: 'Hello API',
  locations: ['ap-south-1'], // overrides the locations property
  frequency: 30, // overrides the frequency property
  request: {
    method: 'GET',
    url: 'https://api.checklyhq.com/public-stats',
    assertions: [{ source: 'STATUS_CODE', comparison: 'EQUALS', target: '200' }]
  }
})
```

# CLI

Dry run all checks in your repo:

```bash
npx checkly test
```

Dry run all checks against a specific location:

```bash
npx checkly test --run-location eu-west-1
```

Deploy all resources to your Checkly account

```bash
npx checkly deploy
```

## Reference

### `checkly test`

Executes all the checks in the scope of your project on the Checkly cloud infrastructure.

- `--run-location <location>`: Run checks against a specified location, e.g. `eu-west-1`. Defaults to `us-east-1`.

### `checkly deploy`

Deploys all your checks and associated resouces like alert channels to your Checkly account.


# API 

## ChecklyConfig

## Checks

### API Checks

### Browser Checks

Browser checks are based on [`@playwright/test`](https://playwright.dev/). You can just write `.spec.js|ts` files with test cases
and the Checkly CLI will pick them up and apply some default settings like a name, run locations and run frequency to turn 
them into synthetic monitoring checks.

However you can override these global settings and configure individual Browser checks just like all other built-in check
types. The most important thing to is set the `code.entrypoint` property and point it to your Playwright `.spec.js|ts` file.

```js
const { BrowserCheck } = require('@checkly/cli/constructs')

new BrowserCheck('browser-check-1', {
  name: 'Browser check #1',
  frequency: 10, // minutes
  regions: ['us-east-1', 'eu-west-1'],
  code: {
    entrypoint: './home.spec.js'
  }
})
```
