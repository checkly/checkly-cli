# Checkly

The Checkly CLI provides all the required information via the `npx checkly skills` command.

Use `npx checkly skills` to list all available actions, and `npx checkly skills <action>` to access up-to-date information on how to use the Checkly CLI for each action.

## Progressive Disclosure via `npx checkly skills`

The skill is structured for efficient context usage:

1. **Metadata** (~80 tokens): Name and description in frontmatter
2. **Core Instructions** (~1K tokens): Main SKILL.md content with links to reference commands
3. **Reference Commands** (loaded on demand): Detailed construct documentation with examples

Agents load what they need for each task.

## Confirmation Protocol

Write commands (e.g. `incidents create`, `deploy`, `destroy`) return exit code 2 with a `confirmation_required` JSON envelope instead of executing. **Always present the `changes` to the user and wait for approval before running the `confirmCommand`.** Never auto-append `--force`. This applies to every write command individually — updates and resolutions need confirmation too, not just the initial create.

Run `npx checkly skills communicate` for the full protocol details.
