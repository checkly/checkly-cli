Checkly practices responsible disclosure.

## Supported Versions

Security updates are only released for the current version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We request that you contact us directly to report serious issues that might impact the security of `@checkly/cli`.

If you contact us regarding a serious issue:

- We will endeavor to get back to you within 72 hours.
- We will aim to publish a fix within 30 days.
- We will disclose the issue (and credit you, with your consent) once a fix to resolve the issue has been released.
- If 90 days has elapsed and we still don't have a fix, we will disclose the issue publicly.

Currently, the best way to report an issue is by contacting us via email at security@checklyhq.com.

For less serious issues it is appropriate to submit these these publically as bug reports or feature requests or to raise a question to open a discussion around them.
